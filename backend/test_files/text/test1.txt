Abstract
An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of
a col lection of mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. In this paper we present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each
Mobile Host operates as a specialized router, and routes
are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little
or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new
routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic selfstarting network, as required by users wishing to utilize
ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even
while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does
not require global periodic routing advertisements, the
demand on the overal l bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantial ly less than in those protocols
that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can stil l maintain most of the advantages of basic
distance-vector routing mechanisms. We show that our
algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes
wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an
evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify
the operation of our algorithm.

1. Introduction
Laptop computers continue to show improvements
in convenience, mobility, memory capacity, and availability of disk storage. These smaller computers can
be equipped with gigabytes of disk storage, high resolution color displays, pointing devices, and wireless
communications adapters. Moreover, because many of
these small (in size only) computers operate with battery power, users are free to move about at their convenience without being constrained by wires.
The idea of forming an on-the-y ad-hoc network of
mobile nodes dates back to DARPA packet radio net- work days [11, 12]. More recently the interest in this
subject has grown due to availability of license-free,
wireless communication devices that users of laptop
computers can use to communicate with each other.
Several recent papers on this topic have focused on the
algorithmic complexity of choosing the optimal set of
ad-hoc routers [6, 8, 15], while others have proposed
new routing solutions [4, 7, 10, 14, 16, 18] leveraging features from the existing Internet routing algorithms. Interest within the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) is also growing as is evidenced by the formation of a new working group (manet [5, 13]) whose
charter is to develop a solution framework for routing in ad-hoc networks. The manet working group has
goals that are quite distinct from the goals of the IETF
mobileip working group, and make little or no use of
Mobile IP [20] or any of its forerunners (e.g., [9, 22]).
The Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector
(DSDV) algorithm has been proposed [18] as a variant
of the distance vector routing method by which mobile
nodes cooperate to form an ad-hoc network. DSDV is
eective for creating ad-hoc networks for small populations of mobile nodes, but it is a fairly brute force
approach because it depends for its correct operation
on the periodic advertisement and global dissemination of connectivity information. Frequent system-wide
broadcasts limit the size of ad-hoc networks that can
eectively use DSDV because the control message overhead grows as O(n2
). DSDV also requires each mobile
node to maintain a complete list of routes, one for each
destination within the ad-hoc network. This almost al- ways exceeds the needs of any particular mobile node.
Keeping a complete routing table does reduce route acquisition latency before transmission of the rst packet
to a destination. It is, however, possible to design a sysAuthorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Santa Barbara. Downloaded on January 10,2026 at 17:26:38 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 
tem whereby routes are created on-demand (e.g., [10]).
Such systems must take steps to limit the time used for
route acquisition; otherwise, users of the ad-hoc nodes
might experience unacceptably long waits before transmitting urgent information. The advantage here is that
a smoothly functioning ad-hoc system with on-demand
routes could largely eliminate the need for periodic
broadcast of route advertisements. With the goals of
minimizing broadcasts and transmission latency when
new routes are needed, we designed a protocol to improve upon the performance characteristics of DSDV
in the creation and maintenance of ad-hoc networks.
Although AODV does not depend specically on
particular aspects of the physical medium across which
packets are disseminated, its development has been
largely motivated by limited range broadcast media
such as those utilized by infrared or radio frequency
wireless communications adapters. Using such media,
a mobile node can have neighbors which hear its broadcasts and yet do not detect each other (the hidden terminal problem [21]). We do not make any attempt to
use specic characteristics of the physical medium in
our algorithm, nor to handle specic problems posed
by channelization needs of radio frequency transmitters. Nodes that need to operate over multiple channels are presumed to be able to do so. The algorithm
works on wired media as well as wireless media, as long
as links along which packets may be transmitted are
available. The only requirement placed on the broadcast medium is that neighboring nodes can detect each
others' broadcasts.
AODV uses symmetric links between neighboring
nodes. It does not attempt to follow paths between
nodes when one of the nodes cannot hear the other one;
however we may include the use of such links in future
enhancements. Steps to prevent use of such asymmetric links between nodes are described briey in Section 2.4.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, the protocol details for AODV are given.
Section 3 presents the simulations, input parameters,
and results obtained. Section 4 describes our plans for
future work, and nally Section 5 concludes the paper.
2. The Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance
Vector Algorithm
Our basic proposal can be called a pure on-demand
route acquisition system; nodes that do not lie on active paths neither maintain any routing information
nor participate in any periodic routing table exchanges.
Further, a node does not have to discover and maintain
a route to another node until the two need to communicate, unless the former node is oering its services
as an intermediate forwarding station to maintain connectivity between two other nodes.
When the local connectivity of the mobile node is
of interest, each mobile node can become aware of the
other nodes in its neighborhood by the use of several
techniques, including local (not system-wide) broadcasts known as hel lo messages. The routing tables of
the nodes within the neighborhood are organized to optimize response time to local movements and provide
quick response time for requests for establishment of
new routes. The algorithm's primary objectives are:
 To broadcast discovery packets only when necessary
 To distinguish between local connectivity manage- ment (neighborhood detection) and general topology maintenance
 To disseminate information about changes in local connectivity to those neighboring mobile nodes
that are likely to need the information.
AODV uses a broadcast route discovery mechanism [4], as is also used (with modications) in the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) algorithm [10]. Instead
of source routing, however, AODV relies on dynamically establishing route table entries at intermediate
nodes. This dierence pays o in networks with many
nodes, where a larger overhead is incurred by carrying source routes in each data packet. To maintain
the most recent routing information between nodes, we borrow the concept of destination sequence numbers from DSDV [18]. Unlike in DSDV, however, each
ad-hoc node maintains a monotonical ly increasing sequence number counter which is used to supersede stale
cached routes. The combination of these techniques
yields an algorithm that uses bandwidth eciently (by
minimizing the network load for control and data traf-
c), is responsive to changes in topology, and ensures
loop-free routing.
2.1. Path Discovery
The Path Discovery process is initiated whenever a
source node needs to communicate with another node
for which it has no routing information in its table.
Every node maintains two separate counters: a node
sequence number and a broadcast id. The source node
initiates path discovery by broadcasting a route request
(RREQ) packet to its neighbors. The RREQ contains
the following elds:
< source addr; source sequence #; broadcast id;
dest addr; dest sequence #; hop cnt >
2
Authorized licensed use limited to: Univ of Calif Santa Barbara. Downloaded on January 10,2026 at 17:26:38 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 
The pair < source addr; broadcast id > uniquely
identies a RREQ. broadcast id is incremented whenever the source issues a new RREQ. Each neighbor
either satises the RREQ by sending a route reply
(RREP) back to the source (see Section 2.1.2), or rebroadcasts the RREQ to its own neighbors after increasing the hop cnt. Notice that a node may receive multiple copies of the same route broadcast packet from
various neighbors. When an intermediate node receives
a RREQ, if it has already received a RREQ with the
same broadcast id and source address, it drops the redundant RREQ and does not rebroadcast it. If a node
cannot satisfy the RREQ, it keeps track of the following information in order to implement the reverse path
setup, as well as the forward path setup that will accompany the transmission of the eventual RREP:
 Destination IP address
 Source IP address
 Broadcast id
 Expiration time for reverse path route entry
 Source node's sequence number.

Path Formation
2.1.1. Reverse Path Setup
There are two sequence numbers (in addition to
the broadcast id) included in a RREQ: the source sequence number and the last destination sequence number known to the source. The source sequence number
is used to maintain freshness information about the reverse route to the source, and the destination sequence
number species how fresh a route to the destination must be before it can be accepted by the source.
As the RREQ travels from a source to various destinations, it automatically sets up the reverse path from
all nodes back to the source [4], as illustrated in Figure 1. To set up a reverse path, a node records the
address of the neighbor from which it received the rst
copy of the RREQ. These reverse path route entries are
maintained for at least enough time for the RREQ to
traverse the network and produce a reply to the sender.
2.1.2. Forward Path Setup
Eventually, a RREQ will arrive at a node (possibly
the destination itself ) that possesses a current route to
the destination. The receiving node rst checks that
the RREQ was received over a bi-directional link. If
an intermediate node has a route entry for the desired
destination, it determines whether the route is current
by comparing the destination sequence number in its
own route entry to the destination sequence number
in the RREQ. If the RREQ's sequence number for the
destination is greater than that recorded by the intermediate node, the intermediate node must not use its
recorded route to respond to the RREQ. Instead, the
intermediate node rebroadcasts the RREQ. The intermediate node can reply only when it has a route with
a sequence number that is greater than or equal to
that contained in the RREQ. If it does have a current
route to the destination, and if the RREQ has not been
processed previously, the node then unicasts a route reply packet (RREP) back to its neighbor from which it
received the RREQ. A RREP contains the following
information:
< source addr; dest addr; dest sequence #; hop cnt; lif etime >
By the time a broadcast packet arrives at a node
that can supply a route to the destination, a reverse path has been established to the source of the
RREQ (Section 2.1.1). As the RREP travels back
to the source, each node along the path sets up a
forward pointer to the node from which the RREP
came, updates its timeout information for route entries to the source and destination, and records the
latest destination sequence number for the requested
destination. Figure 2 represents the forward path
setup as the RREP travels from the destination D
to the source node S. Nodes that are not along the
path determined by the RREP will timeout after ACTIVE ROUTE TIMEOUT (3000 msec) and will delete
the reverse pointers.
A node receiving an RREP propagates the rst
RREP for a given source node towards that source.
If it receives further RREPs, it updates its routing information and propagates the RREP only if the RREP
3

contains either a greater destination sequence number
than the previous RREP, or the same destination sequence number with a smaller hopcount. It suppresses
all other RREPs it receives. This decreases the number of RREPs propagating towards the source while
also ensuring the most up-to-date and quickest routing
information. The source node can begin data transmission as soon as the rst RREP is received, and can
later update its routing information if it learns of a
better route.
2.2. Route Table Management
In addition to the source and destination sequence
numbers, other useful information is also stored in the
route table entries, and is called the soft-state associated with the entry. Associated with reverse path
routing entries is a timer, called the route request expiration timer. The purpose of this timer is to purge
reverse path routing entries from those nodes that do
not lie on the path from the source to the destination.
The expiration time depends upon the size of the adhoc network. Another important parameter associated
with routing entries is the route caching timeout, or the
time after which the route is considered to be invalid.
In each routing table entry, the address of active
neighbors through which packets for the given destination are received is also maintained. A neighbor
is considered active (for that destination) if it originates or relays at least one packet for that destination
within the most recent active timeout period. This information is maintained so that all active source nodes
can be notied when a link along a path to the destination breaks. A route entry is considered active if
it is in use by any active neighbors. The path from
a source to a destination, which is followed by packets along active route entries, is called an active path. Note that, as with DSDV, all routes in the route table
are tagged with destination sequence numbers, which
guarantee that no routing loops can form, even under
extreme conditions of out-of-order packet delivery and
high node mobility (see Appendix A).
A mobile node maintains a route table entry for each
destination of interest. Each route table entry contains
the following information:
 Destination
 Next Hop
 Number of hops (metric)
 Sequence number for the destination
 Active neighbors for this route
 Expiration time for the route table entry
Each time a route entry is used to transmit data
from a source toward a destination, the timeout
for the entry is reset to the current time plus active route timeout.
If a new route is oered to a mobile node, the mobile node compares the destination sequence number
of the new route to the destination sequence number
for the current route. The route with the greater sequence number is chosen. If the sequence numbers are
the same, then the new route is selected only if it has
a smaller metric (fewer number of hops) to the destination.
2.3. Path Maintenance
Movement of nodes not lying along an active path
does not aect the routing to that path's destination.
If the source node moves during an active session, it
can reinitiate the route discovery procedure to establish a new route to the destination. When either the
destination or some intermediate node moves, a special
RREP is sent to the aected source nodes. Periodic
hel lo messages can be used to ensure symmetric links,
as well as to detect link failures, as described in Section 2.4. Alternatively, and with far less latency, such
failures could be detected by using link-layer acknowledgments (LLACKS). A link failure is also indicated if
attempts to forward a packet to the next hop fail.
Once the next hop becomes unreachable, the node
upstream of the break propagates an unsolicited RREP
with a fresh sequence number (i.e., a sequence number
that is one greater than the previously known sequence
number) and hop count of 1 to all active upstream
neighbors. Those nodes subsequently relay that message to their active neighbors and so on. This process continues until all active source nodes are notied;
it terminates because AODV maintains only loop-free
routes and there are only a nite number of nodes in
the ad-hoc network.
Upon receiving notication of a broken link, source
nodes can restart the discovery process if they still require a route to the destination. To determine whether
a route is still needed, a node may check whether the
route has been used recently, as well as inspect upperlevel protocol control blocks to see whether connections remain open using the indicated destination. If
the source node (or any other node along the previous route) decides it would like to rebuild the route to
the destination, it sends out an RREQ with a destination sequence number of one greater than the previously known sequence number, to ensure that it builds
a new, viable route, and that no nodes reply if they
still regard the previous route as valid.

2.4. Local Connectivity Management
Nodes learn of their neighbors in one of two ways.
Whenever a node receives a broadcast from a neighbor, it updates its local connectivity information to
ensure that it includes this neighbor. In the event
that a node has not sent any packets to all of its active downstream neighbors within hello interval, it
broadcasts to its neighbors a hel lo message (a special unsolicited RREP), containing its identity and
sequence number. The node's sequence number is
not changed for hel lo message transmissions. This
hel lo message is prevented from being rebroadcast outside the neighborhood of the node because it contains a time to live (TTL) value of 1. Neighbors
that receive this packet update their local connectivity information to the node. Receiving a broadcast
or a hel lo from a new neighbor, or failing to receive
allowed hello loss consecutive hel lo messages from
a node previously in the neighborhood, is an indication that the local connectivity has changed. Failing to receive hel lo messages from inactive neighbors
does not trigger any protocol action. If hel lo messages are not received from the next hop along an active path, the active neighbors using that next hop
are sent notication of link failure as described in
Section 2.3. We have determined the optimal value
for allowed hello loss is two, as is shown in Section 3.2.
The local connectivity management with hel lo messages can also be used to ensure that only nodes with
bidirectional connectivity are considered to be neighbors. For this purpose, each hel lo sent by a node lists
the nodes from which it has heard. Each node checks
to make sure that it uses only routes to neighbors that
have heard the node's hel lo message. To save local
bandwidth, such checking should be performed only if
explicitly congured into the nodes.
3. Simulations and Results
We have simulated AODV using an event-driven,
packet-level simulator called PARSEC[1], which was
developed at UCLA as the successor to Maisie[2]. The
PARSEC language is suited to the simulation of dynamic topologies and routing algorithms.
The main objective of our simulations is to show
that on-demand route establishment with AODV is
both quick and accurate. Additional objectives include
showing that AODV scales well to large networks, and
determining the optimal value for each of the necessary
parameters.
3.1. Simulation Environment
Our simulations were run using networks of 50, 100,
500, and 1000 nodes. The movement algorithm for all
network sizes is the same. Nodes are initially placed
randomly within a xed-size L  L area. During the
simulation, nodes are free to move anywhere within this
area. Each node chooses a speed from a uniform distribution between 0.4 and 0.8 meters per second. It then
travels towards a random spot within the L  L area. The node moves until it reaches that spot, then chooses
a rest period from a uniform distribution between 60
and 300 seconds. After the rest period, the node travels
towards another randomly selected spot. This process
repeats throughout the simulation, causing continuous
changes in the topology of the underlying network.
Each of the simulations also uses the same channel
model. Before beginning a transmission, carrier sensing is performed by a node to determine whether any
of its neighbors is transmitting. If the node detects an
ongoing transmission by a neighbor, it calculates an exponential backo based on the number of times it has
attempted the retransmission and waits this amount of
time before listening to the channel again. A node attempts to transmit a packet max retrans times before
dropping the packet.
Nodes in the simulation frequently suer from the
hidden terminal problem. If node A transmits to node
B, and node C, unable to hear node A's transmission,
simultaneously transmits to node B, we assume the
packets collide at node B and both packets are dropped.
Each node creates a session to another node selected
at random. The sessions created for each simulation

are of homogeneous type; they are either small data
(S DATA) packets or voice data. The parameters for
each of the session types are given in Table 1. We chose
to use the small data packet sessions for most of our
simulations because the larger size of the voice packets
and the greater number of sessions generated tended to
congest the network and hence decrease the goodput
ratio. Nevertheless, we include the results from these
simulations to oer a contrast to the lighter demands
of the small data packets and to place a greater stress
on the protocol.
A session sends data segments until either it has
sent the desired number of segments or it receives a
timeout message from the network layer. Timeouts are
triggered when a node has sent a RREQ for a particular
destination and has not received a valid route within
route discovery timeout. Any time a route is not
available during a session, packets are dropped by the
network layer. The data rate for both session types is
1.0 Mbit/sec.
Each simulation is run for 600 seconds, and new sessions are generated throughout the simulation. Hence, we keep track of, and account for, any uncompleted
sessions and data packets in transit at the end of the
simulation.

The interconnection pattern of an ad-hoc network
is determined in part by the communication range
(Rmax). For our simulations, we held Rmax constant
at 10m. Two nodes can communicate directly, and are
thus considered each other's neighbors, if they are less
than Rmax distance apart. The room size for the 50
and 100 nodes networks is 50m50m. For 500 nodes, we found 50m50m to be too small, so we increased the
dimensions to 100m100m. Similarly, for 1000 nodes we used a room size of 150m150m.
Table 2 gives the values of the essential parameters
for AODV. The parameter values were chosen because
they minimize network congestion while allowing the
algorithm to operate as quickly and as accurately as
possible.
3.2. Results and Discussion
Our rst objective was to show that AODV can
nd routes quickly and accurately. Since we did not
at this time know an optimal value for rreq retries
and allowed hello loss, we varied rreq retries between 0 and 3 and set allowed hello loss to 2, a
value we intuitively guessed would be reasonable. Figure 3 shows the goodput ratios for 50 and 100 nodes
using the S DATA session type. For 50 nodes, the
goodput ratio is consistently above 98%. For 100
nodes, the goodput ratio for rreq retries=0 is approximately 96%, but then it decreases to 92% for
rreq retries=1 and then increases with increasing
values of rreq retries. Broch et al. [3] simulated
AODV over a network of 50 nodes and achieved goodput ratios between 97% and 100%, depending on the
amount of time the nodes were stationary during the
simulation. Note that our S DATA simulation uses
the same size data packets as they did. Hence, our

Figure 5. Route Acquisition Latency for
Varying rreq retries
achieved goodput ratio for a 50 node network roughly
corresponds with their results for the same size net- work, with our results being slightly better. We disregard the articially high goodput ratio for 100 nodes
and rreq retries=0 because 20% more of the sessions aborted in this simulation than in the simulations
with larger rreq retries values. Given the remaining
goodput ratios for 50 and 100 nodes, we set the optimal
rreq retries value to 2.
We then simulated 50 and 100 nodes networks
with rreq retries=2 and varied the allowed
hello loss parameter. The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 4. Here, for 50 nodes,
allowed hello loss=2 produced the best results,
while for 100 nodes allowed hello loss=0 was the
best. Again, because 0 is an unrealistic value, and
because allowed hello loss=2 produced the second
best results, we chose allowed hello loss = 2 to be
the optimal value. This contradicts Broch et al.'s
nding that allowed hello loss = 3 produces better performance. In their simulations they also used
rreq retries = 3. The combination of the two parameters may account for the slightly decreased goodput that their AODV simulations produced. Another
signicant dierence between their simulation and ours
is that they set ROUTE DISCOVERY TIMEOUT to
6000 msec, whereas we found the optimal value to be
1000 msec.
To show that AODV nds routes in a timely manner, we examined the route acquisition latency. The
route acquisition latency was computed by noting the
simulation time when an initial RREQ was broadcast
for a given destination, and then noting the time when
the rst RREP was received at the source. For successive RREQ retries for the same route, the start
time for the route was held at the time at which the

rst RREQ was sent. If a route to a destination was
never found, this time lapse was not taken into account
in the computation. Figure 5 shows the computed
route acquisition latencies for varying rreq retries
values, and Figure 6 shows the corresponding values
for varying allowed hello loss values. With the
exception of rreq retries = 0, the minimum route
acquisition latency was attained for the combination
rreq retries=2, allowed hello loss=2, giving further credence to our choice of parameter values.
Table 3 gives the essential results of our simulations
for networks of 50, 100, 500, and 1000 nodes. The results were obtained using the S DATA session type, and
setting rreq retries=2 and allowed hello loss=2.
The bandwidth overhead ratio is a metric taken from
[17] (although there it is called bandwidth utilization),
and is computed by dividing the total number of bits
transmitted by the total number of data bits transmitted. We include this calculation because it gives
a good representation of the amount of control overhead associated with a protocol. We also report both
the instantaneous goodput ratio at the simulation end,
as well as the average goodput ratio throughout the
simulation, because these numbers can vary due to
a sudden increase in link breakages or session creations at the end of the simulation. The 1000 node
simulation was run for a shorter period of time because of the diculty of running such a large simulation. Also, the 500 and 1000 node simulations had
a slightly larger session generation interval than the
50 and 100 nodes networks in order to keep the total number of sessions more manageable. We note
that the results of the 500 and 1000 node networks
are not as good as we would have desired. Reasons
for the decreased goodput ratio are a much greater
collision rate, due to the increase in the number of

nodes and the longer paths causing a greater likelihood for collisions during the hop-by-hop forwarding of the message, and the added interference of all
the hello messages. Also, the route acquisition latency increased due to the larger average path length
and the additional delay in control message transmission because of increased competition for channel
access. However, regardless of the decreased perfor- mance values, AODV is currently one of the most
scalable ad-hoc routing protocols. We feel that with
networks this large we are pushing the current capabilities of mobile networks, as we are not aware of
any other attempts to model networks of such a large
size.
We also ran simulations of the 50 and 100 node net- works using the voice session type described in Section 3.1. We used this session type to stress the abilities of AODV. The results of these simulations, together with the comparable results from the S DATA
session type, are given in Table 4. The two important results from these simulations are the goodput ratio and the bandwidth overhead ratio. The
goodput ratio for the voice session type was lower
than that of the S DATA sessions. This is due to
the fact that there were signicantly more collisions
due to the longer data packet lengths. Also, because the data packets were larger and took longer
to transmit, we found that the queues of the nodes
frequently backed up because they had to wait for
channel access for possibly lengthy periods of time,
causing delays in sending RREQs and RREPs. On
the other hand, if we compare the bandwidth overhead ratio between the two session types, we nd that
the voice sessions had more optimal results than the
S DATA sessions. This is because for virtually the
same amount of control overhead (i.e. the same number
of RREQs and RREPs), the voice sessions send many
more data bits because of the increased data packet
size.
4. Current Status and Future Work
Currently, AODV has been specied in an Internet Draft [19] submitted to the IETF manet working
group. There are a number of further improvements
which may support larger populations of ad-hoc users,
or improve response time to route queries, or increase
the capabilities of the protocol.
4.1. Multicast
Multicast, as a basic tool for conferencing applications, must be considered when designing routing algorithms for ad-hoc networks. We have already enhanced AODV to provide multicast capability. Multicast using AODV follows directly from the Route
Request/Route Reply message cycle and requires only
one additional message type, the Multicast Validation
Message. Nodes in the network that are members
of the same multicast group, together with the nodes
used as routers to connect group members, form a bidirectional multicast tree across which multicast data
packets are relayed. The MACT message is used to
select the node which a source node chooses as its next
hop for the multicast tree. Additionally, there is a multicast group leader that is responsible for incrementing
the multicast group sequence number. More details of
the multicast portion of AODV can be found in [19].

4.2. Intermediate Node Route Rebuilding
Route rebuilding after a link breakage is currently
the responsibility of the source node. However, one alternative to this method is to allow the node upstream
of the break to try to repair an active (i.e. recently
used) route before sending the link failure notication.
Because the next hop with which it lost contact is likely
to still be in the near vicinity and haveavalid route
to the destination, the TTL value of the RREQ sent
by the intermediate node can be small so that the link
failure can be localized.
A tradeo between quickly reestablishing the route
and preventing the source node from continuing to send
data packets exists when allowing intermediate nodes
to rebuild routes. Allowing intermediate node route rebuilding could provide for quicker route reconstruction
and fewer dropped packets if the route is able to be
reconstructed quickly. On the other hand, more data
packets will have been lost during an unsuccessful reconstruction attempt than would have been if a link
failure notication had been sent at the initial discovery of the broken link. We plan to investigate which
method is superior in terms of goodput and latency.
4.3. Elimination of Hello Messages
Hello messages, while allowing nodes to learn about
neighbor changes in a timely manner, create extra control overhead and increase bandwidth consumption.
We chose to include hello messages in the design of
AODV because we did not want AODV to have to rely
on an underlying MAC-sublayer protocol. However, we are currently investigating ways of eliminating the
need for hello messages, while still allowing AODV to
operate independently from such an underlying protocol.
4.4. Locality of Association and QoS
We expect improvements to the latency of establishing routes by exploiting locality of association.
This may, for instance, lead to transmitting additional
route information along a backbone. Such backbone
nodes might perform intermediate varieties of route
request propagation before relaying such requests indiscriminately, further improving bandwidth utilization. Another alternative could be that mobile nodes
that are currently corresponding might oer to exchange their local routing tables with each other,
thus reducing further the setup time required for any
of their mutual neighbors to communicate with each
other.
QoS is another important feature of routing protocols. AODV has been enhanced to provide basic QoS
services, namely delay and bandwidth assurances. We
plan to investigate the ecacy of these additions in the
near future.
5. Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a distance vector algorithm that is suitable for use with ad-hoc networks.
AODV avoids problems with previous proposals (notably DSDV) and has the following features:
 Nodes store only the routes that are needed
 Need for broadcast is minimized
 Reduces memory requirements and needless duplications
 Quick response to link breakage in active routes
 Loop-free routes maintained by use of destination
sequence numbers
 Scalable to large populations of nodes.
Compared to DSDV, and other algorithms which store
continuously updated routes to all destinations in the
ad-hoc network, our algorithm has longer latency for
route establishment, but we have taken the following
steps to alleviate this problem:
 A route to a destination may be returned by any
intermediate node
 Link breakages are reported immediately, and
routes are quickly re-established

 Inactive routes are quickly aged out of the system
because they are more likely to go stale.
Some improvements are enabled by careful bookkeeping and by associating each route with a list of active
neighbors.
We conclude that, within the limits imposed by worst-case route establishment latency as determined
by the network diameter, AODV is an excellent choice
for ad-hoc network establishment. It will be useful
in applications for emergency services, conferncing,
battleeld communications, and community-based net- working. We look forward to further development of
the protocol for quality of service, intermediate route
rebuilding, and various interconnection topologies with
xed networks and the Internet.

A. Proof of the Loop-free Property
Verifying that AODV establishes only loop-free
routes is easy because of the eect of the destination sequence number on the maintenance of routes. Suppose
that there is a loop in a route to a destination Z, and
that nodes Xi are the nodes in the loop for i=1,2,:::,n. As a matter of terminology, we say that Xi \points to"
Xj (symbolically, Xi ! X j ) if the routing table entry
of Xi for destination Z shows node Xj as the next hop
to Z. Then, for each Xi, Xi ! X i+1 for i=1,2,:::,n,
and furthermore Xn ! X 1. Let Ti be the destination sequence number for
the route entry at Xi for destination Z. Then,
Ti  Ti+1 whenever Xi ! Xi+1, because of the
processing of the RREP specied in Section 2.1.2.
Since T 1  T2  :::  Tn  T 1, evidently
the destination sequence numbers are the same for
every node Xi in the routing loop. Moreover,
if it were possible to create a routing loop, this
equality would have to hold the instant the loop was
created. Furthermore, because the destination sequence numbers are all the same, the next hop information must have been derived at every node Xi from
the same RREP transmitted by the destination Z. Consider now the metrics mi to the destination Z.
Since Xi ! Xi+1 only if mi = mi+1 + 1, then m1 = mn + (n  1). But because Xn ! X1, mn = m1 + 1,
and n = 0; this is a contradiction.
An inductive argument is also possible. Letting k
be the minimum length of a routing loop, one could
always construct another routing loop of length k  1
just by modifying the routing table at the node Xk to
point to X2 instead of of X1. This works as long as
k  3, showing that it is only possible to construct
a routing loop of length 2. Then a simple argument
using destination sequence numbers. RREP handling
shows that routing loops cannot have length 2, so that
routing loops cannot contain more than one node. But
this means that there cannot be any routing loops.
