LINEAR ALGEBRA: A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW
======================================

Preface
-------
Linear algebra is a foundational subject in mathematics with applications across science,
engineering, computer science, economics, and data analysis. At its core, linear algebra
studies vector spaces, linear transformations between them, and the systems of equations
that arise from these structures. This text aims to provide a detailed, conceptually deep,
and cohesive introduction to linear algebra, similar in spirit to a traditional textbook.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 1: Systems of Linear Equations
-------------------------------------
A system of linear equations is a collection of equations of the form

    a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₙxₙ = b

where the variables x₁, ..., xₙ appear only to the first power and are not multiplied
together. Such systems arise naturally in modeling real-world problems, such as balancing
chemical equations, analyzing electrical circuits, and fitting data to linear models.

The central questions are:
1. Does the system have a solution?
2. If so, is the solution unique?
3. If not unique, how many solutions exist?

Gaussian elimination is a systematic method for transforming a system into an equivalent
one that is easier to solve. This process relies on elementary row operations:
- Swapping two rows
- Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar
- Adding a multiple of one row to another

These operations preserve the solution set of the system.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2: Matrices and Matrix Algebra
--------------------------------------
Matrices provide a compact and powerful way to represent linear systems. A matrix is a
rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The augmented matrix of a system
encodes both coefficients and constants in a single object.

Matrix operations include:
- Addition and scalar multiplication
- Matrix multiplication
- Transposition

Matrix multiplication is not commutative, reflecting the fact that composition of linear
transformations depends on order. The identity matrix plays a role analogous to the number
1 in multiplication.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 3: Determinants
----------------------
The determinant is a scalar value associated with a square matrix. Geometrically, the
absolute value of the determinant represents the scaling factor by which a linear
transformation changes area or volume.

Key properties of determinants:
- A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero
- Swapping two rows changes the sign of the determinant
- Determinants are multiplicative: det(AB) = det(A)det(B)

Determinants also provide explicit formulas for solutions of linear systems via Cramer's
Rule, though this is mainly of theoretical interest.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4: Vector Spaces
-----------------------
A vector space is a set V equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar
multiplication, satisfying a collection of axioms (closure, associativity, distributivity,
etc.). Examples include:
- Rⁿ
- The space of polynomials
- The space of continuous functions

Subspaces are subsets of vector spaces that are themselves vector spaces. The span of a set
of vectors is the smallest subspace containing them.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5: Linear Independence, Basis, and Dimension
----------------------------------------------------
A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be written as a linear combination
of the others. A basis of a vector space is a linearly independent set that spans the space.

Every vector in a finite-dimensional vector space can be written uniquely as a linear
combination of basis vectors. The number of vectors in a basis is the dimension of the
space.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 6: Linear Transformations
---------------------------------
A linear transformation is a function T: V → W that preserves addition and scalar
multiplication. Linear transformations can always be represented by matrices once bases
are chosen.

Important concepts include:
- Kernel (null space): vectors mapped to zero
- Image (range): vectors that are outputs of T
- Rank and nullity

The Rank-Nullity Theorem states:
    dim(V) = rank(T) + nullity(T)

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 7: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
---------------------------------------
Eigenvectors of a matrix A are nonzero vectors v such that:
    Av = λv
for some scalar λ, called an eigenvalue.

Eigenvalues reveal deep structural properties of linear transformations, including
stability, long-term behavior, and diagonalizability.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 8: Diagonalization and Spectral Theory
----------------------------------------------
A matrix is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. Diagonalization simplifies
many computations, especially matrix powers.

For symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices, the Spectral Theorem guarantees an orthonormal basis
of eigenvectors, making these matrices particularly well-behaved.

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 9: Inner Product Spaces
-------------------------------
An inner product introduces geometry into linear algebra, allowing definitions of length,
angle, and orthogonality. Common examples include the dot product in Rⁿ.

Key results include:
- Orthogonal projections
- Gram–Schmidt process
- Least squares approximation

------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 10: Applications and Further Topics
--------------------------------------------
Linear algebra underpins:
- Machine learning and data science
- Computer graphics
- Quantum mechanics
- Optimization and numerical analysis

Advanced topics include singular value decomposition, Jordan canonical form, and numerical
linear algebra.

------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
----------
Linear algebra provides a unifying language for modern mathematics and its applications.
Mastery of its concepts enables deeper understanding across disciplines and serves as a
gateway to advanced study in both pure and applied mathematics.
