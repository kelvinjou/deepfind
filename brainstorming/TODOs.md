- Database stuff
    - setup data tables
        - files table (metadata + FKEY to chunks?)
        - chunks table
    - ~~setup offline supabase~~
    - ~~create SQL function to retrieve results~~
- Preprocessing
    - ~~chunk overlapping preprocessing (text)~~
    - ~~transcribing audio to text (WhisperX)~~
    - ~~image summarization step - ask chatgpt to create a summary in text~~
        - [~~https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision~~](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision)
    - PDF image preprocessing step - create image of each page and ask gpt to look for images or diagrams and summarize them (OpenAI CLIP)
        - extract image from pdf: [https://medium.com/@alexaae9/python-how-to-extract-images-from-pdf-documents-9492a767a613](https://medium.com/@alexaae9/python-how-to-extract-images-from-pdf-documents-9492a767a613)
        - OCR the text from the PDF - chunk this
        - possibly use medium article above to extract image from PDF and then use CLIP?
- ~~Querying~~
    - ~~ranking algo with heuristics~~
- other low priority features
    - GUI for file explorer
    - user interactions with the file in the GUI
    - Commands
        - /summarize - summarize a specific document
        - /move - move a specific document to a different location
    - Convert all commands to agent tools
    - file change detection using some sort of watcher and compare hash stored in metadata
